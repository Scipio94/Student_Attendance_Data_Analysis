# Student Attendance Data Analysis

## Abstract 

There has been an ongoing issue of attendance tracking and chronic absenteeism at Foundation Academies for the 2022-2023 school year. The goal of this analysis is to identify students who are understood to be chronically absent and devise a plan of action to meet our long term goals.

## Variables

![Student Attendance Analysis ERD ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112409778/232087501-0c1562be-c5ee-4015-a10d-641d73adfd84.png)


## Objective

The objective of the analysis is to determine the percentage of the student population that is considered to be chronically absent and if there is an impact on academic performance of students. The questions below will guide the analysis:

1. How many students are currently considered chronically absent by state attendance policy?
2. How many students currently have twelve (12) or more absences?
3. Does chronic absenteeism have a negative impact on academic performance?

## Analysis

1. **How many students are currently considered chronically absent by state attendance policy?**

According to the New Jersey Department of Education (NJDE) chronic absenteeism is defined by a student being absent 10% or more of the school days in a school year. Currently 22%(235) students are considered to be chronically absent. The High School campus has the highest rate of chronic absenteeism with 29%( 86) of their students being considered chronically absent. Lastly, the 12th Grade is the grade with the highest  rate of chronic absenteeism with 47% (34) of their students considered chronically absent.

2. **How many students currently have twelve (12) or more absences?**

The local attendance policy at Foundation Academy is that if a student has twelve (12) or more absences they’ll be retained. To calculate the total number of absences of a student, add the total number of absences and one-third of the total number of tardies.The analysis of the local attendance policy will be segmented into two attendance calculation of absences including tardies and calculation of absences without tardies.

Not including tardies, 33% (341) of students exceed twelve (12) or more absences. On average students have 10 absences. The high school campus has the highest average absence count, 12, of all campuses, and the 12th grade has the highest average absence count,18, of all grades.Additionally, 37% of both the Primary School and High School’s population exceeds twelve (12) or more absences. Lastly, the 56% (41) of the 12th grade’s student population exceeds twelve (12) or more absences.

Including tardies, 48% (504) of students exceed twelve (12) or more absences. On average students have 15 absences, already surpassing the local attendance policy of twelve (12) or more absences. The high school campus has the highest average absence count, 21, and 12th grade has the highest average absence count of any grade, 28. Additionally, 64%(191) the high school’s population exceeds twelve (12) or more absences. Lastly, 78% (57) of 12th grade has twelve or more absences. 

3. **Does chronic absenteeism have a negative impact on academic performance?**

![ELA iReady Data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112409778/232072954-7581ebef-c3f7-42e0-8462-e2884c669473.jpg)

Yes, chronic absenteeism has a negative impact on academic performance. In the comparison of iReady 1 and 2 results students who were chronically absent were less likely to be on grade level or in Tier 1. For example, there was a 13% increase in the Tier 1 percentage in ELA within the population of students who aren’t considered to be absent compared to an 8% increase of students who are considered to be chronically absent. Additionally, 31% of students who aren’t chronically absent are in Tier 1 on average in ELA compared to 22% of students who are chronically absent being in Tier 1 on average in ELA. 

## Recommendations

Based on the metrics above, the Data and Assessment Team recommends amending the local attendance policy just for this year as it is not plausible to retain 48% (504) per our current attendance policy. There is also the option to recommend that students must report to summer school, or they’ll be retained.
